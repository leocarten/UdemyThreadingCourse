- Asynchronous programming is like doing things concurrently
- Synchronous programming is like doing things sequentially, one-by-one

- How to change a synchronous function to async:
int Calculate(); BECOMES --> Task<int> Calculate();
and now... we can consume this asynchronous function like so:
async void Food()
{
	int n = await Calculate();
}

- As i saw earlier, when you do a Sleep(5000); or Delay(5000); ... it blocks the UI thread
	- when the UI thread gets blocked, then it cant be interacted with (resized, clicked, etc...)
	- so, you need to perform your computation in a new thread or task to NOT block the UI thread
